# clicky-game
A fun time wasting game featuring your favorite Star Wars Characters.

## What is it?
The idea is to never click the same picture twice while the pictures shuffle after every click. You continue to score points until all pictures are selected with no duplicates.

### Note:

Ok, So I borrowed a lot of code from the assignments. I felt like I had a good idea the first day, but passing in state and props and all that jazz threw me for a loop and I had a hell of a week outside of class. Even borrowing heavily and playing with the code definitely contributed greatly to further understanding on my part on how React works under the hood. 

Definitely will come in handy when working on our project.
