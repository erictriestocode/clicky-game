# clicky-game
A fun time wasting game featuring your favorite Star Wars Characters.

## What is it?
The idea is to never click the same picture twice while the pictures shuffle after every click. You continue to score points until all pictures are selected with no duplicates.

## How do I play?
Just visit https://clicky-game-eric.herokuapp.com/

Alternatively, if you are interested in seeing how it runs under the hood:
* Clone this Repo
* grab the package dependencies with npm install
* start your local webserver with npm start
* Visit localhost:3000 in your browser to begin playing!

### Note:

Ok, So I borrowed a lot of code from the assignments. I felt like I had a good idea the first day of React, but passing in state and props and all that jazz threw me for a loop and I had a hell of a week outside of class. Even borrowing heavily and playing with the code definitely contributed greatly to further understanding on my part on how React works under the hood. 

Definitely will come in handy when working on our project.
